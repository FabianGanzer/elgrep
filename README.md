Open the `elgrep-menu` via menu item "Tools" â†’ "Search files (Elgrep)...".
There are menu items for the directory, the file name regexp for filtering
and the regexp for grepping. Furthermore, you can also switch on recursive grep.

Run <kbd>M-x</kbd> `elgrep` to search a single directory for files with file
name matching a given regular expression for text matching a given
regular expression. With prefix arg <kbd>C-u</kbd> it searches the directory
recursively.
